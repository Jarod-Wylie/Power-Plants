# Power Plants

## Game Play Instructions

### Goal
If the fire goes out then the game is over! Luckily you can keep the fire going by feeding it wood. Also luckily you can harvest plants for wood and seeds and plant those seeds to grow more plants to harvest for wood and seeds and so on...

There is a timer to help you keep track of how long you can last on each attempt.

This game is built in the spirit of a RougeLike so try to embrace losing early and trying to learn the rules to growing the plants on your own. If you get too frustrated check the Other Notes and Tips in this Readme for spoilers.

### Controls
W: Move Up
A: Move Left
S: Move Down
D: Move Right

H: Harvest plants for firewood and seeds
P: Plant seeds to grow more plants
J: Spend wood to feed fire (must be standing on a tile directly next to the fire)
G: Pick up tools(only tool in game is Hoe)
I: Dig an irrigation canal (must be standing on a tile directly next to water or existing canal) -- you will need to be holding the Hoe to be able to do this.

### Other Notes and Tips
Planting Rules:
- A plant must be planted a full square a part from another plant unless the plant is beside water
- A plant will not reach its ideal growth stage if it is planted directly next to the lake. Planting must be at least a square away from the lake to be able to reach its ideal growth stage
